# A Perl subroutine or function is a group of statements that together performs a task.
# Perl uses the terms subroutine, method and function interchangeably.

# The main() call can happen before the main method is defined.

# Defining a Subroutine:
# sub subroutine_name {
# 	body of the subroutine
# }

# Calling a Subroutine:
# subroutine_name( list_of_arguments );


# Function definition
sub hello {
   print "Hello, World!\n";
}

# Function call
hello();

# Funcation call without paranthesis
hello;


# Output:
# Hello, World!
# Hello, World!
